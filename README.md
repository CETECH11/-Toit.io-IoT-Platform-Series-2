Created by former Google Employees, Toit was a concept to make IoT Devices easily accessible, to monitor and control for enterprise uses. To simply secure the code on our ESP32 microcontrollers with lightweight containers and orchestrate them through our cloud API.

It uses sandbox containers, where our applications run isolated from the system, and each other, on the devices. Communicate with our cloud through a simple API (CLI), we take care of the rest.We own our data and we get to store it wherever we want. Feed data from our devices directly into your own system using HTTPS or MQTT, or let the platform help us get our bits to and from our devices. It is as simple as that.

Deploy code, access logs, update firmware, and install applications on your devices. Let your data flow into your own system, and share it with your customers. They just handle your microcontrollers.Get full visibility into your device fleet with logs covering connectivity, code execution, and crash reports. Trace the bug, fix it and redeploy, all within minutes. Assign your devices into groups and deploy updates on a group-by-group basis.

All these high level complex features, with the help of Toit.

Toit platform is built on the free and open-source object-oriented Toit language, so we write applications in a high-level, memory-safe language and let the battery-optimized virtual machine execute them efficiently on your ESP32. Fast to develop, safe to run. Let us call it a language for the IoT.
There are two ways to get started with setting up and using the Toit Cloud - Toit Web Console and CLI using Jaguar.

Jaguar is a small Toit application that runs on your ESP32. It uses the capabilities of the Toit virtual machine to let you update and restart your ESP32 code written in Toit over WiFi. Change your code in your editor, update it on your device, and restart it all within seconds. No need to flash over serial, reboot your device, or wait for it to reconnect to your network.
